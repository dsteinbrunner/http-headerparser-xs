HTTP::HeaderParser::XS
Perlbal::XS::HTTPHeaders
========================

This module is a parser for HTTP headers, written in C++.  It uses classes
internally to provide a fast and easy to use interface to parsing,
creating, and working with HTTP headers.

This module is designed for use in Perlbal, a software HTTP load balancer
by Danga Interactive (now Six Apart).

In order to use this module, you will need the Perl development libraries
along with a C++ compiler and some random assorted things that convert XS
files into C (etc).  (Not sure if this is part of the Perl development
libraries or not... but it should be pretty standard.)


INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Alternately, if you're on Debian...

   dh-make-perl --build
   dpkg -i ../whatever.deb

Once installed, if you are using this from within Perlbal you can simply
type 'xs enable headers' to use the XS headers within Perlbal.  If you are
using the non-Perlbal interface for this module, simply using the module
is enough.
